// Main Thread

public class DeadlockExample {

//    A deadlock occurs in concurrent programming when two or more threads are blocked forever,
//    each waiting for the other to release a resource. This typically happens when threads hold
//    locks on resources and request additional locks held by other threads. For example,
//    Thread A holds Lock 1 and waits for Lock 2, while Thread B holds Lock 2 and waits for Lock 1.
//    Since neither thread can proceed, they remain stuck in a deadlock state.
//    Deadlocks can severely impact system performance and are challenging to debug and resolve
//    in multi_threaded applications.
